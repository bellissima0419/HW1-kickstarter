## Conclusions:

1. There seems to be a strong preference for projects related to art and entertainment( theater music and film & video).

2. Surprisingly for me, technology doesn't to be a  strong  field on kickstarter and within this field the winners are not software related projects but hardware related ones. My interpretation is that there's a preference for technology that can be interacted with on a physical level. Perhaps humans are going back to having a preference for real tangible interactions with its environment and getting more excited about this than the virtual experiences of the digital world for example, the Tabletop games seem to have had more success than the video games.

3. Within the food category, a big loser is the food trucks subcategory. Perhaps kickstarter backers stay away from labor intensive endeavors that are difficult to scale as each food truck requires roughly the same amount of effort and resources  as the previous one.


## Limitations:

* The dataset is somewhat dated as the most recent records are almost 2 years old.

* There's no  information about the entrepreneurs background, ages, demographics, etc
participating in the projects as this could possible be a good measure or indicator of future success

* There are no details about the projects themselves (history, capital investment, years in development, financial information etc)
